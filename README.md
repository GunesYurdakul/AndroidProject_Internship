# AndroidProject_Internship

This project is an android application developed by me during my summer internship at YapÄ± Kredi Teknoloji.
It is my first android experience and java as well. Since I'm a newbie at android, the aim was to learn Android Programming.

Using this app you can arrange your project plans, add new projects, add task to this projects andd assign your employees to created tasks.
